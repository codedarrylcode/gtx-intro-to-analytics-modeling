    "## Optimization Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Three key pieces of optimization modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Decisions to be made where values can be changed to maximize/minimize the objective function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example: political candidate scheduling\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - $x_i = \\text{total time spent in state i}$\n",
    "    - $y_i = \\text{number of visits to state i}$\n",
    "    - $z_i = \\text{1 if state i is ever visited, else 0}$\n",
    "    - $w_{id} = \\text{time spent in state i on day d}$\n",
    "    - $v_{id} = \\text{1 if state i visited on day d, else 0}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Constraints**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Restrictions on variable values, e.g. 30 days left in the campaign, $\\therefore \\sum_i x_i \\leq 30$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Objective function**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Measure of the solution's quality, for e.g. Maximize expected new votes on a political schedule.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $\\sum_i (\\alpha p_i \\sqrt{x_i + \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{j \\in N(i)} x_j} + \\beta v_{id} f{d})$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Diet problem in US Army\n",
    "\n",
    "    Satisfy soldiers' nutritional requirements at minimum cost, given:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - $n$ foods\n",
    "    - $m$ nutrients\n",
    "    - $a_{ij} = \\text{amount of nutrient j per unit of food i}$\n",
    "    - $m_j = \\text{minimum daily intake of nutrient j}$\n",
    "    - $M_j = \\text{maximum daily intake of nutrient j}$\n",
    "    - $c_i = \\text{per-unit cost of food i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Model is defined as such:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Variables: $x_i = \\text{amount of food i in daily diet}$\n",
    "    - Constraints:\n",
    "        - $\\sum_i a_{ij} x_i \\geq m_j$\n",
    "        - $\\sum_i a_{ij} x_i \\leq M_j$\n",
    "        - $x_i \\geq 0$ for each food i\n",
    "    - Objective function: $\\min \\sum_i x_i c_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Call center scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Meet forecasted demand $d$ for each day\n",
    "    - Minimize slack by minimizing workers required to meet demand\n",
    "    - Each worker works 5 days in a row then 2 days off\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Variables\n",
    "        - $x_i = \\text{number of people who start working on day i}$\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Objective function\n",
    "        - $\\min 5(x_{sunday} + x_{monday} + \\dots)$\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Constraints\n",
    "        - Meet demand: $\\sum_{\\text{j working on day i}} x_j \\geq d_i$\n",
    "        - $x_i \\geq 0$ for all days $i$\n",
    "        - $x_i$ is integer\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Solving optimization models**\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, solving optimization models goes like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let $x$ be a vector of variables\n",
    "- Minimize or maximize objective function, $f(x)$\n",
    "- Variables $x$ must belong to a set $X$, such that $x \\in X$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Stochastic optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "In regular optimization problems, variables and constraints are treated as deterministic, known values with no uncertainty (i.e. using expectations).\n",
    "\n",
    "What if parameters have a distribution and forecast values aren't known exactly, i.e. how do we deal with optimization problems under *uncertainty*?\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple way to deal with uncertainty is to model conservatively:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: Call center worker constraint\n",
    "    - $x_{fri} + x_{sat} + \\dots \\geq d_{tue} + \\theta$\n",
    "    - where $\\theta = \\text{extra workers just in case}$ \n",
    "    - $\\theta$ can be probabilistically modeled based on demand understanding\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Another way to deal with uncertainty is to do scenario modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define primary scenarios and optimize over each of them\n",
    "- Using the call center worker example\n",
    "    - $x_i = \\text{number of workers starting 5-day shift on day i}$\n",
    "    - $d_{is} = \\text{expected demand on day i in scenario s}$\n",
    "    - Define constraints for each scenario's demand and optimize $x_i$ to meet all constraints or the weighted expectation given the probability of each scenario\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "**Dynamic Program**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Has states and its respective pay-off values\n",
    "- Decisions (choices of next state)\n",
    "- Using Bellman's equation helps us to decide optimal decisions based on pay-off values\n",
    "- A stochastic dynamic program has probabilities of next state's payoffs\n",
    "    - If such program comes with discrete states and decisions then it is also known as the *Markov Decision Process* \n",
