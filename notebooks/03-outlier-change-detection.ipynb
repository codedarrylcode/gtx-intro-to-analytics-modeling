    "An outlier is a data point that's very different from the rest of the dataset. These outliers can be caused by poor measurements, wrong data input or contaminated experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Point outliers**: Values are far from the rest of the data\n",
    "- **Contextual outliers**: Value isn't far from the rest overall but is far from points nearby in time\n",
    "- **Collective outliers**: Something is missing in a time-series range of points but can't tell exactly where\n",
    "\n",
    "One classic way to identify outliers visually is to use the **box-and-whisker** plot to observe data points outside of the whiskers. Another approach could be to fit an **exponential smoothing model** where points with very large errors might be outliers. The modeling approach means that we can also fit a logistic regression model to estimate the probability of an outlier happening under different conditions.\n",

    "One basic way to detect changes in metrics is to use the cumulative sum approach, i.e. *has the mean of the observed variable gone beyond the expected level*? \n",
